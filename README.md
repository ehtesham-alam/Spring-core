# Spring-core
This is a repo which contains all the concepts of the spring core.

* Spring core is the main topic which has been covered.

The spring-aop module provides an AOP Alliance-compliant aspect-oriented programming
implementation allowing you to define, for example, method interceptors and pointcuts to cleanly
decouple code that implements functionality that should be separated. Using source-level metadata
functionality, you can also incorporate behavioral information into your code, in a manner similar to that
of .NET attributes.
